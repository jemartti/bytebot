A simple command line utility to help you build bytes.

ByteBot connects your Byte app on your phone to your local development environment (or really to any url you enter).  As you make changes to your Byte, they show up on your phone, allowing you to rapidly hack on your Byte and get instant visual feedback on the phone.

Check out the [Byte API Docs](https://github.com/onehq/byte-api) for more details on how to build a Byte.

If you have ANY questions hop into our IRC channel. We'll get back to you immediately.
